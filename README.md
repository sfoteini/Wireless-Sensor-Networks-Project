# Applications of Telecommunication Devices - Project

This assignment was part of the course Applications of Telecommunication Devices (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 8th semester). The purpose of the assignment is to design a wireless sensor network using Arduino UNO, low cost sensors and the ALOHA protocol.

**Project description**

In this project, a wearable device was created for health monitoring of people with Multiple Sclerosis using Arduino UNO and low-cost sensors, and a wireless sensor network was designed for patient health monitoring in a clinical setting.

The following sensors were used to measure the desired characteristics:
* DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
* DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Cable
* AD8232 Single Lead Heart Rate Monitor
* ADXL335 triple axis accelerometer

The ALOHA protocol was used for wireless communication between network nodes. The ALOHA protocol is a low-complexity contention-based communication protocol.
